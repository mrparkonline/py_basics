    "# Data & Variables\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Majority of the time you will be dealing with data contained in variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Data:__ Any representable information for us to grab, show and manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Variables:__ A labeled container that holds data for us to reference to in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "__Integers__: Integers are numbers that range from negative infinity to positive infinity. Now computers have limitations based on their computer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples: ```1, -1, 42, 1000```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Floating Point Values:__ Floating Points are what we call decimals in computer programming; moreover, floating points represent all the real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: ```0.5, 3.14, 3.649```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Booleans:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean data type can only have two values → __True__ or __False__. These values are often used in conditional or decision making situations. If a certain situation is True, then a Boolean value is generated by the program, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Strings:__ Strings are considered a collection of alphanumeric and special symbols. A single alphanumeric or special symbol are sometimes called a character. To denote that a value is a string, we trap it inside double or single quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: ```“Hello”, “Park”, “3.14”, “42” … “” or ‘’ are empty strings```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Lists:__ Lists are a collection of different and multiple data types; moreover, it is one of the way to have a collection of values. We denote the start and the end of a list with square brackets, and separate values are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: ```[“Apple”, “Orange”, “Watermelon”], [1,2,3,4,5], [ ]```\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ Strings and Lists have their own units of study due to their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "_Just like in math, computer programming is dependent on the manipulation of variables. However, there will be huge differences._\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to hold values of data. Since variables hold data, the variable itself will be __TYPED__ based on its containing value. To create a variable, we denote a name to the left, and value to the right by using an equal sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "__FORMAT:__ label = value\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Variable Naming Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You don’t start a variable with capitals\n",
    "2. There are no white spaces, we connect multi word variables with either camelCasing or under_scores.\n",
    "3. Variable names should be effective and short, not vague.\n",
    "4. Do not use any [built-in function names](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) nor [keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) as variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Naming Convention Set from the Python Organization:\n",
    "- The variable name describes its data that it contains\n",
    "- The variable name exists on its own\n",
    "    - doesn’t require abbreviation\n",
    "    - it not a shortened form of a word\n",
    "- The variable name is not ambiguous\n",
    "- The variable name does not contain any whitespace \n",
    "- The variable name does not start with numbers\n",
    "- The variable name does not start with capital letters (6ix is a very bad variable name)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Names: ```under_scoring```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a variable name that requires multiple words to describe the data, you can separate the words with an underscore (-)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "first_name = “Mr.”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Names: ```camelCasing```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike separating multiple words with an underscore, we can also combine them by capitalizing the words after the first. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a rule that, in Python, your variable should not start with capitals, but camelCasing will allow us to capitalize our subsequents words after the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "firstName = “Mr.”\n",
    "```"
