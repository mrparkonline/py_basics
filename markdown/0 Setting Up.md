# Setting Up
---

Easiest way to start coding in Python is to use a web service from [repl.it](https://repl.it)

If you'd like to use native software or other set ups please follow the guides below:
- For Windows: [Guide Link from Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
- For macOS: [Guide Link from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-macos)

**It will be assumed that you will be coding on repl.it. You may require additional setting configurations if you are using a different setup.**



## Starting with repl.it

![](figures/01_f1.png)

**To Do List:**
1. Create an account. No need to select the _I'm a teacher_ option.
2. Click on the blue button with a plus sign to create a new python file.
3. Call your python file: "My First Python Program"

## My First Python Program

Examine the figure above, there are three vertical columns of importance:

1. File Directory
2. Code Editor
3. Python Interpreter

#### 1. File Directory

As your python projects get more advanced, you will be creating more files here. The basics course will mainly deal with just editing our _"main.py"_ file.

#### 2. Code Editor

This is where you write your python code.
- To left we have numbers letting us know which line we are at
- Python is a Top-Down Intrepreted Language; therefore, Python will execute the lines of code starting at Line 0 all the way until it reaches the end of the file
- Currently we've wrote some lines of code that are executable.

#### 3. Python Interpreter

This is where we get to see our code in action.
- It will start from Line 0 from our editor
- It will start to read line by line
- If there is an _output_ to be made on the interpreter, it will be outputted on the interpreter.

_At the moment, I have some code written down. Please feel free to copy it._

To see all of this in action, please press **Run**.


```python
# My First Python Program
# By: Mr. Park

print('Hello, World!')
```

    Hello, World!


## Important repl.it Settings to Change

**Before we talk about what the hashtag was and what ```print()``` was, we need to set up repl.it for Python Programming.**

![](figures/01_f3.png)

#### Settings to Change:
1. Indent Type: Set to **Spaces**
2. Indent Size: Set to **4**

_These are the recommended (and basically mandatory) set up set by the [Python Organization](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation)_

#### Optional Settings to Change:
- Layout
- Theme
- Font Size

_These you can set to your liking._

#### Settings to not change:
- keybinds
- wrapping
- code intelligence

_It is recommended not to change these as a beginner programmer. I personally have code intelligence off to help me memorize better._

**This concludes the set up portion.**
